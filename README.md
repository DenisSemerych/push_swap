# push_swap
42 algorithmic project
Purpose of this project is to create two different programs: checker and push_swap.
Checker needs to take int values as arguments and than waits for list of instruction from standart input. 
Push_swap needs to take int values as arguments and than generates list of instruction to standart output.


usage: console_name% $ARG=4 2 3 15 12 51 8 ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG.

Speed - fast.
Sorting - excelent on 500, 100 - not so good, but on average few than 700 instructions.
Used algo: Quick Sort modification.
